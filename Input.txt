How to storage and contain the data - pick a data structure 

Inputs:
# of cities =  int
	No -num

Population of cities = int [ ]
	Length is == to # of cities
No -num
	Each element can be a large number
	Immutable

City location = int [ ] 		
Length is == to # of cities
No -num
Each element can be a large number

# of cloud = int 
	No -num
	Could be a big number
	Max is half max of cities
No city in the same location

Cloud location = int
	Length is == to # of cloud
	No -num or 0 value
	Each element can be a large #
	shared location 

Cloud range = int
	Length is == to # of cloud
	No -num or 0 value
	Each element can be a large #
	r effects both direction (location + range, location - range)

Output: 
Max number of sunny people - removing 1 cloud = single integer

Note : 
Any city with no clouds donâ€™t check - Add popul to const max people then splice
Any cloud not over any city splice from array
Any city covered by two clouds splice from array
Any cloud covered by another cloud > first check for double cities then splice
